### Instruction: You should only reply with one answer in JSON format containing two keys: 'columns' and 'methods'. The value of 'columns' is a list of columns' headers relevant to the given statistical question, and the value of 'methods' is a list containing all methods you think applicable. For example: {""columns"": [""c1"", ""c2"", ""...""], ""methods"": [""m1"", ""m2"", ""...""]}. If you think there is a strata or control variable involved, put its column header in the last item of the columns list. Ensure your methods selection is only limited to the classification list provided.

2023 Netflix Engagement Dataset,"Since launching our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists in 2021, Netflix has provided more information about what people are watching than any other streamer except YouTube. And now we believe it’s time to go further.

Starting today we will publish What We Watched: A Netflix Engagement Report twice a year. This is a comprehensive report of what people watched on Netflix over a six month period1, including:

Hours viewed for every title — original and licensed — watched for over 50,000 hours2;

The premiere date3 for any Netflix TV series or film; and

Whether a title was available globally.

In total, this report covers more than 18,000 titles — representing 99% of all viewing on Netflix — and nearly 100 billion hours viewed.

Over 60% of Netflix titles released between January and June 2023 appeared on our weekly Top 10 lists. So while this report is broader in scope, the trends reflected in it are very similar to those in the Top 10 lists, including:

The strength of returning favorites like Ginny & Georgia, Alice in Borderland, The Marked Heart, Outer Banks, You, Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, XO Kitty and film sequels Murder Mystery 2 and Extraction 2;

The popularity of new series like The Night Agent, The Diplomat, Beef, The Glory, Alpha Males, FUBAR and Fake Profile, which generate huge audiences and fandoms;

The size of the audience of our films across every genre including The Mother, Luther: The Fallen Sun, You People, AKA, ?Que viva México! and Hunger;

The enthusiasm for non-English stories, which generated 30% of all viewing;

The staying power of titles on Netflix, which extends well beyond their premieres. All Quiet on the Western Front, for example, debuted in October 2022 and generated 80M hours viewed between January and June; and

The demand for older, licensed titles, which generates tremendous value for our members and for rights holders.

When reading the report it’s important to remember:

Success on Netflix comes in all shapes and sizes, and is not determined by hours viewed alone. We have enormously successful movies and TV shows with both lower and higher hours viewed. It’s all about whether a movie or TV show thrilled its audience — and the size of that audience relative to the economics of the title; and

To compare between titles it’s best to use our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists, which take into account run times and premiere dates.

This is a big step forward for Netflix and our industry. We believe the viewing information in this report — combined with our weekly Top 10 and Most Popular lists — will give creators and our industry deeper insights into our audiences, and what resonates with them.",https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/netlifx-hour-2023

Customer Personality Analysis Dataset,"Problem Statement

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

Target
Need to perform clustering to summarize customer segments.

Netflix TV Shows and Movies Scores Dataset in IMDB,"The Netflix TV Shows and Movies dataset provides comprehensive information about various titles available on the popular streaming platform. The dataset includes details such as the title's name, its type (whether it is a TV show or a movie), a brief description of the content, the year it was released, age certification rating, runtime (for TV shows: length of episodes; for movies: duration), IMDb score, and IMDb votes.

By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the distribution of IMDb scores and ratings for both TV shows and movies available on Netflix. This information can help us understand the popularity and reception of titles based on user ratings.

The dataset has been carefully curated to ensure accuracy and relevance. It excludes any null values in IMDb scores to maintain data integrity. Each entry also contains an ID that corresponds to JustWatch (a platform for legal streaming) as well as the respective title ID on IMDb.

To visualize the distribution of IMDb scores effectively, we will be using histograms. Histograms categorize data into bins or intervals based on a chosen metric (in this case: IMDb score). The length of each bar within a bin represents the number of titles falling within that particular range of scores. With correct binning techniques, we can observe patterns and trends in how different shows and movies are rated by viewers.

When creating your visualization using Tableau or any other tool you prefer, feel free to experiment with color schemes to enhance your chart's visual impact without overshadowing its analytical purpose. However, remember not to sacrifice clarity and simplicity in pursuit of creativity.

We encourage you to take your time in crafting an insightful visualization over the next week. Once completed, share it on Tableau Public or through social media platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn using #B2VB hashtag while tagging ReadySetData and ItsElisaDavis for recognition. Don't forget to fill out our submission form on Back 2 Viz Basics website to officially participate in the challenge.

Best of luck, and we look forward to seeing your visualization!

Pokedex Dataset,"Context
With the rise of the popularity of machine learning, this is a good opportunity to share a wide database of the even more popular video-game Pokémon by Nintendo, Game freak, and Creatures, originally released in 1996.

Pokémon started as a Role Playing Game (RPG), but due to its increasing popularity, its owners ended up producing many TV series, manga comics, and so on, as well as other types of video-games (like the famous Pokémon Go!).

This dataset is focused on the stats and features of the Pokémon in the RPGs. Until now (08/01/2017) seven generations of Pokémon have been published. All in all, this dataset does not include the data corresponding to the last generation, since 1) I created the databased when the seventh generation was not released yet, and 2) this database is a modification+extension of the database ""721 Pokemon with stats"" by Alberto Barradas (https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon), which does not include (of course) the latest generation either.

Content
This database includes 21 variables per each of the 721 Pokémon of the first six generations, plus the Pokémon ID and its name. These variables are briefly described next:

Number. Pokémon ID in the Pokédex.
Name. Name of the Pokémon.
Type_1. Primary type.
Type_2. Second type, in case the Pokémon has it.
Total. Sum of all the base stats (Health Points, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed).
HP. Base Health Points.
Attack. Base Attack.
Defense. Base Defense.
Sp_Atk. Base Special Attack.
Sp_Def. Base Special Defense.
Speed. Base Speed.
Generation. Number of the generation when the Pokémon was introduced.
isLegendary. Boolean that indicates whether the Pokémon is Legendary or not.
Color. Color of the Pokémon according to the Pokédex.
hasGender. Boolean that indicates if the Pokémon can be classified as female or male.
Pr_male. In case the Pokémon has Gender, the probability of its being male. The probability of being female is, of course, 1 minus this value.
Egg_Group_1. Egg Group of the Pokémon.
Egg_Group_2. Second Egg Group of the Pokémon, in case it has two.
hasMegaEvolution. Boolean that indicates whether the Pokémon is able to Mega-evolve or not.
Height_m. Height of the Pokémon, in meters.
Weight_kg. Weight of the Pokémon, in kilograms.
Catch_Rate. Catch Rate.
Body_Style. Body Style of the Pokémon according to the Pokédex.
Notes
Please note that many Pokémon are multi-form, and also some of them can Mega-evolve. I wanted to keep the structure of the dataset as simple and general as possible, as well as the Number variable (the ID of the Pokémon) unique. Hence, in the cases of the multi-form Pokémon, or the ones capable of Mega-evolve, I just chose one of the forms, the one I (and my brother) considered the standard and/or the most common. The specific choice for each of this Pokémon are shown below:

Mega-Evolutions are not considered as Pokémon.
Kyogre, Groudon. Primal forms not considered.
Deoxis. Only normal form considered.
Wormadam. Only plant form considered.
Rotom. Only normal form considered, the one with types Electric and Ghost.
Giratina. Origin form considered.
Shaymin. Land form considered.
Darmanitan. Standard mode considered.
Tornadus, Thundurus, Landorus. Incarnate form considered.
Kyurem. Normal form considered, not white or black forms.
Meloetta. Aria form considered.
Mewstic. Both female and male forms are equal in the considered variables.
Aegislash. Shield form considered.
Pumpkaboo, Gourgeist. Average size considered.
Zygarde. 50% form considered.
Hoopa. Confined form considered.
Acknowledgements
As said at the beginning, this database was based on the Kaggle database ""721 Pokemon with stats"" by Alberto Barradas (https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon). The other resources I mainly used are listed below:

WikiDex (http://es.pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/WikiDex).
Bulbapedia, the community driven Pokémon encyclopedia (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).

Possible future work
This dataset can be used with different objectives, such as, Pokémon clustering, trying to find relations or dependencies between the variables, and also for supervised classification purposes, where the class could be the Primary Type, but also many of the other variables.

US Christmas Tree Sales Dataset,"This dataset provides a comprehensive record of the annual Christmas tree sales in the United States from 2010 to 2016. The dataset consists of six columns which include relevant information about each year's sales data.

The Year column indicates the specific year in which the Christmas tree sales data was recorded, allowing analysts to compare and track trends over time.

The Type of tree column specifies the various species or types of Christmas trees that were sold during each particular year, enabling researchers to analyze market preferences and consumer choices.

The Number of trees sold column represents the total quantity of Christmas trees that were purchased by customers in a given year. Identifying fluctuations in this metric can offer insights into changes in demand and market performance.

The Average Tree Price column provides important information on pricing dynamics within the industry. By calculating and tracking this average price for each year, analysts can assess variations in consumer spending behavior as well as identify potential economic factors influencing purchasing decisions.

Finally, the Sales column presents valuable data on total revenue generated from these Christmas tree sales annually. This metric offers a holistic perspective on market performance and business profitability within the holiday season.

Overall, this detailed dataset serves as a reliable resource for researchers aiming to understand historical trends and patterns within the US Christmas tree industry from 2010 to 2016. By analyzing variations across years, types of trees, number of units sold, average prices, and total sales revenue statistics, professionals can gain meaningful insights into consumer preferences while also uncovering opportunities for growth or operational improvements within this festive market segment
